# PyBer Analysis
This Analysis was done for the ride sharing app PyBer. Analysis was done to see the average fares, drivers, and rides for work done in Rural, Urban, and Suburban environments. 

# Summary

As to be expected, Urban environments make up the majority of both rides and drivers. The following graphs clearly show how Urban production is the driving force behind PyBer.
