# PyBer Analysis
This Analysis was done for the ride sharing app PyBer. Analysis was done to see the average fares, drivers, and rides for work done in Rural, Urban, and Suburban environments. Analysis was performed with Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook on Python 3.9.5.

# Summary

As to be expected, Urban environments make up the majority of both rides and drivers. The following graphs clearly show how Urban production is the driving force behind PyBer.

Total Rides
- Rural 125
- Suburban 625
- Urban 1625

Total Drivers
- Rural 78
- Suburban 490
- Urban 2405

Total Fares
- Rural $4,327
- Suburban $19,356
- Urban $39,854

Average Fare per Ride
- Rural $34.62
- Suburban $30.97
- Urban $24.53

Average Fare per Driver
- Rural $55.49
- Suburban $39.50
- Urban $16.57

- The data shows that 62% of all fares are generated in an Urban environment, compared to 30% in Suburban and only 6.8% in Rural.
- Nearly 81% of all drivers are located in an Urban Environment. 
- Accordingly with the other data cited, Urban riders accounted for $39,854 in fares, more than twice the amount that Suburban riders accounted for ($19,356), and almost 10x as much as Rural ($4,327). 

## Suggestions
Given the massive demand in Urban sectors, PyBer should consider increasing the number of urban Drivers. They could also consider hiring more rural drivers to make rates cheaper if they're looking to expand further into Rural markets. If not, cutting Rural markets and turning full time to Urban and Suburban seems like the better investment.
